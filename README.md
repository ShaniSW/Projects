## Introduction

I am a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights from data and helping businesses make data-driven decisions. My expertise lies in Python and SQL, which I use extensively to clean, analyze, and visualize data.

This portfolio includes several projects that highlight my analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and technical expertise. Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## Projects

### Project 1: Neurocognitive Methodology in Learning Mathematics - Bibliographic Project

#### Description:

Participated in a comprehensive bibliographic project as part of a larger survey, focusing on the systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of neurocognitive methodologies applied to learning mathematics. 

This innovative project, conducted in collaboration with a university in Israel and other international institutions, represents a significant shift in research methodology. It leverages big data, encompassing approximately 600 articles, to expand the scope of research from individual subjects to the sources themselves, aligning with a growing trend in higher education.

**Key contributions include:**

- **Data Retrieval:** Extracted data from Scopus and Web of Science using API keys.
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned data by removing accents, extracting country names, and filtering records based on standardized terminology and relevant keywords.
- **Data Analysis:** Implemented Python scripts for detailed analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visual representations through graphs and Excel tables.

**Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, Jupyter Notebook), Excel.
